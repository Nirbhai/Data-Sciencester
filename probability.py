For a data scientist it is beneficial to think of Probability 
as a way of quantifying the uncertainty associated with events 
chosen from some universe of events.
Rather than getting technical about what these terms mean, 
think of rolling a die. The universe consists of all possible outcomes. 
And any subset of these outcomes is an event; 
for example, “the die rolls a 1” or “the die rolls an even number.”
    - Joel Grus


Notationally, we write P(E) to mean “the probability of the event E”

"""
    Roughly speaking, we say that two events E and F are dependent 
    if knowing something about whether E happens 
    gives us information about whether F happens (and vice versa). 
    Otherwise, they are independent.
    For instance, if we flip a fair coin twice, 
    knowing whether the first flip is heads 
    gives us no information about whether the second flip is heads. 
    These events are independent. 
    On the other hand, knowing whether the first flip is heads
    certainly gives us information about whether both flips are tails.
    These two are dependent events.
